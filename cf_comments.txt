***** for P1:  **********
   I'd propose for last slide: 
       in short: 
       (a) node embedding (= feature extraction = rep. learning)
       (b) pattern/rule extraction

  [this leads to Leman's part, on rep. learning]

*** for P2: ****
    a) as little work as possible - say, pick your latest tutorial / talk
       and use most/all of those slides
    b) for the other papers (spotLight, Fraudar, etc), just give 
       the citations (
         'dense block detection algorithms include CopyCatch[], Fraudar[], ..'


*** for all: **********
    A) any 'thanks' for funding agencies etc?
      [please put them in a pptx file, say P[12]_thanks.pptx  ]
    
    B) contact email address?
