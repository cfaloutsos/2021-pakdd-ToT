***** for P1:  **********
   I'd propose for last slide: 
       in short: 
       (a) node embedding (= feature extraction = rep. learning)
       (b) pattern/rule extraction

  [this leads to Leman's part, on rep. learning]

*** for all: **********
A) any 'thanks' for funding agencies etc?
  [please put them in a pptx file, say P[12]_thanks.pptx  ]

B) contact email address?
