Title: Anomaly detection in graphs - past, present and future.
Speakers: Leman Akoglu, Mary McGlohon and Christos Faloutsos

Abstract:
    In 2010, OddBall proposed a method to find unusual nodes in a large graph.
    First we present its main idea; then we list follow up work
    on node, subgraph, and graph level anomaly detection and representation learning; and conclude with future directions.
